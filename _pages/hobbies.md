- **Math:** I am particularly fascinated by "Set Theory" and recently immersed myself in proving propositions within it. Furthermore, with the writing of "Taller and Higher," I have also delved into "Mathematical Logic."
- **Algorithm:** Although I don't participate in competitions, I find algorithmic problems very interesting. Here is the repository of problems I have coded [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/algorithm-question-warehouse).
- **Coding:** I enjoy programming and working on projects, especially game development, but I still have much to learn.
- **Music:**  I also love music, especially classical music. I taught myself to play the piano and the trombone. As I enjoy watching animations, I am particularly fond of the tracks adapted by [Animenzzz](https://www.animenzpiano.com).
- **Games:** In my spare time, I also enjoy playing games with friends, mainly "[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net)" and "[Deep Rock Galactic](https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/)". I cherish the feeling of cooperation and trust with others.

### Reinforcemet-Learning

### Genetic Algorithm <!--(https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Genetic_Algorithm) -->
&emsp;&emsp;I've recently developed a keen interest in genetic algorithms and am currently conducting experiments with them. I'm excited to observe their performance in AI and gaming problems. Additionally, I'm considering the possibility of advancing genetic algorithms to reinforcement learning in the future.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Genetic_Algorithm).

### Advanced Data Structure
&emsp;&emsp;I've studied advanced data structures theory, but I wasn't satisfied with just that. Consequently, I've manually implemented many of them, such as Kd-Tree, SkipList, and Sparse Matrix. These implementations are written as templates in C++ to facilitate easy usage. I plan to continue updating this section as I learn more.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Advanced-Data-Structures).

### LZ_STL
&emsp;&emsp;When I first learned C++ and became acquainted with the Standard Template Library (STL), I found myself intrigued by the specific implementation of many of its classes. After learning about their functionality and reviewing the information, I attempted to reproduce some parts. I would like to express my gratitude to my teacher for their invaluable assistance.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The implementation process deviates somewhat from the C++ STL source code; it reflects more of my own approach to functionality. If you share my interest or discover any bugs, please don't hesitate to contact me!<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/LZ_STL).

About me
=====
&emsp;&emsp;I am an undergraduate student at Shandong University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in mathematics, algorithms, and logic-related subjects. To generate ideas, I enjoy programming to validate them. Therefore, if you have novel ideas and need technological support, please feel free to contact me :).

### Reinforcemet-Learning
&emsp;&emsp;After studying and experimenting with genetic algorithms, I believe that reinforcement learning is a better choice for games or strategic problems. Consequently, I began to implement reinforcement learning from scratch in C++ for various specific problems such as rock-paper-scissors, tic-tac-toe, and snake. The algorithms used include Q-Learning and Deep-Q-Learning.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Reinforcemet-Learning).


### Genetic-Algorithm
&emsp;&emsp;I've recently developed a keen interest in genetic algorithms and am currently conducting experiments with them. I'm excited to observe their performance in AI and gaming problems. Additionally, I have advanced from genetic algorithms to reinforcement learning; for more details, see [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Reinforcemet-Learning).<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Genetic_Algorithm).

### The-Cat-Came-To-Me
&emsp;&emsp;This is a command-line based Japanese-style adventure (or narrative) game, inspired by "[Word Game](https://wordgame.cc/)". This is the largest project I have developed to date. Although it is not yet complete, writing a game by hand is truly exciting!<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/The-Cat-Came-To-Me).


### Advanced-Data-Structure
&emsp;&emsp;I've studied advanced data structures theory, but I wasn't satisfied with just that. Consequently, I've manually implemented many of them, such as Kd-Tree, SkipList, and Sparse Matrix. These implementations are written as templates in C++ to facilitate easy usage. I plan to continue updating this section as I learn more.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Advanced-Data-Structures).

### LZ_STL
&emsp;&emsp;When I first learned C++ and became acquainted with the Standard Template Library (STL), I found myself intrigued by the specific implementation of many of its classes. After learning about their functionality and reviewing the information, I attempted to reproduce some parts. I would like to express my gratitude to my teacher for their invaluable assistance.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The implementation process deviates somewhat from the C++ STL source code; it reflects more of my own approach to functionality. If you share my interest or discover any bugs, please don't hesitate to contact me!<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/LZ_STL).

### L-Talk
&emsp;&emsp;This is a simple chat tool running under the Windows operating system, developed using C++ for TCP socket programming. This tool could potentially become the foundation for the multiplayer game The-Cat-Came-To-Me in the future.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be found [here]().

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

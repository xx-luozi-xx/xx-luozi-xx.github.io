About me
=====
&emsp;&emsp;I am a undergraduate student at Shandong University, major in Computer Science and Technology.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in math, algorithms, and logic-related subjects. To generate ideas, I like to program to validate them. Therefore, if you have novel ideas and need technological support, please contact me :).

### Genetic Algorithm <!--(https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Genetic_Algorithm) -->
&emsp;&emsp;I've recently become more interested in genetic algorithms and am doing some experiments on them, looking forward to seeing how genetic algorithms perform on AI, gaming problems, and possibly upgrading genetic algorithms to reinforcement learning in the future.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be referenced [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Genetic_Algorithm).

### Advanced Data Structure
&emsp;&emsp;I've learned some theory of advanced data structures but wasn't satisfied with that and have done manual implementations of many of them.These include Kd-Tree, SkipList, Sparse Matrix, and so on. I've written them as templates in C++ to support easy calls, and this section will continue to be updated as I learn more.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;The code can be referenced [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Genetic_Algorithm).

<!-- Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

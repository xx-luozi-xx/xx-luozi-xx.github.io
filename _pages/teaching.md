### Taller-and-Higher

&emsp;&emsp;This year, while participating in volunteer activities, I met a child with a deep interest in mathematics. I introduced her to many fascinating mathematical concepts. Despite being a primary school student, she showed remarkable talent and a strong passion for mathematics. The eagerness in her eyes strengthened my own educational path and also made me reflect on my past experiences. As a result, I've decided to create a series on popular mathematics (which I plan to eventually turn into a book). <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;I've named this series "Taller and Higher" with the aim of elevating the mathematical landscape and broadening our perspective, looking down from a higher vantage point at everything we have learned.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;For more details, see [here](https://github.com/xx-luozi-xx/Taller-and-Higher).

### algorithm design

&emsp;&emsp;This year, I served as the teaching assistant and lecturer for the course "Programming Design Thinking and Practice," where I explained basic algorithm design to lower-year students (oriented towards CCF SCP certification). I was primarily responsible for creating problems for the "large simulation" type and for explaining all the exercises.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, I have a strong interest in algorithm design and welcome any discussions on related topics.
